# CSS

We adhere to component/module-based approach [css-bliss](./BLISS.md) which shares common ideas with 
[BEM](http://bem.info), [SMACSS](https://smacss.com/), [OOCSS](http://oocss.org/), [SUITECSS](https://github.com/suitcss),
but adds further restrictions to **fix design flaws in CSS**.

This architecture is preprocessor independent. 
We are using SASS to make things DRY.
